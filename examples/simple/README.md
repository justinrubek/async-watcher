# example-simple

This example implements a watcher that prints events and does nothing else.
Since the example depends on certain directories being present, you should run it from the root of the repository.
Run `cargo run --bin example-simple` from the root directory.
Afterwards you may edit the contents of this crate and watch events come through when the files are modified.
